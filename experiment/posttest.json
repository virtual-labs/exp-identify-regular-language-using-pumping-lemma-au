        "a": "To prove that a language is regular",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The lemma does not confirm regularity; it tests non-regularity.",
        "b": "Correct! The Pumping Lemma is mainly used to show that certain languages are not regular.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Shortest strings are unrelated to the lemma.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! The pumped string xy^i z must remain in the language for all i ≥ 0.",
        "b": "Incorrect. There is no requirement for x, y, z to be equal.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Lengths are not required to be equal.",

        "a": "Incorrect. y cannot be empty.",
        "b": "Correct! y must contain at least one symbol to ensure pumping changes the string.",

    {
      "question": "Why does the Pumping Lemma hold for regular languages?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because regular languages can be infinite",
        "b": "Because finite automata have a finite number of states, creating loops in long strings",
        "c": "Because all strings are periodic",
        "d": "Because every string can be divided into three equal parts"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Being infinite is not the reason.",
        "b": "Correct! Loops in finite automata for strings longer than the number of states guarantee the lemma holds.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Not all strings are periodic.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Equal division is not required."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Violation implies non-regularity.",
        "b": "Correct! If any string violates the lemma, the language cannot be regular.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Context-free property is unrelated here.",

      "question": "Which strings in a regular language are considered when applying the Pumping Lemma?",

        "a": "All strings, regardless of length",

        "c": "Only strings longer than or equal to the pumping length",
        "d": "Only strings that contain all symbols of the alphabet"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Only sufficiently long strings are considered.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Short strings do not need pumping.",
