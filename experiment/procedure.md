<u><h3>Procedure</u></h3>
<p>1. To Identify Regular languages using pumping lemma , select any example given and follow the instructions provided .</p>
<p>Read the theorem and click on the start button to start the simulation </p>

<p>select any example and follow the instructions provided </p>
<div><img src="./images/examples.png" alt="select from the examples"><div>
<p>Enter the value for pumping length P </p>
<div><img src="./images/pumping.png" alt="select from the examples"><div>
<p>Enter a string S that is in the language</p>
<div><img src="./images/string.png" alt="select from the examples"><div>
<p>decompose the  string S into xyz</p>
<div><img src="./images/decompose.png" alt="select from the examples"><div>
<p>Enter value of i</p>
<div><img src="./images/ivalue.png" alt="select from the examples"><div>
<p>The lemma states that we can "pump" the substring y  by inserting copies of it "i" times, if all the conditions are satisfied then the string is in the language </p>
<div><img src="./images/success.png" alt="select from the examples"><div>
<p>if any of the conditions are not satified then string is not in the language  you can always find the explanation by clicking on the explanation button </p>
