<h5>1.Regular Language </h5>
<li>A language is regular if  it can be expressed in terms of regular expression </li>
<li>They are languages that can be recognized by finite automata  </li>
<li>Regular expressions can be thought of as the algebraic description of a regular language . </li>
<li>Regular languages have closure properties, meaning that various operations on regular  languages (such as union, concatenation, and Kleene star) result in another regular language.

<h5>Pumping Lemma</h5>
<b>Pumping:</b> The word pumping refers to generating many input strings by pushing a symbol in an input string repeatedly.

<b>Lemma:</b>  The word Lemma refers to the intermediate theorem in a proof.

There are two Pumping Lemmas, that are defined for

<li>Regular Languages</li>
<li>Context-Free Languages</li>

<h5>Pumping Lemma For Regular Languages</h5>
<h6>Theorem: </h6>
<p>If A is a Regular Language, then A has a Pumping Length ‘P’ such that any string ‘S’ where |S ≥ P may be divided into three parts S = xyz such that the following conditions must be true:

1.) xy<sup>i</sup>z ∈ A for every i ≥ 0

2.) |y| > 0

3.) |xy| ≤ P</p>

<p>Pumping Lemma is used as proof of the irregularity of a language. It means, that if a language is regular, it always satisfies the pumping lemma. If at least one string is made from pumping, not in language A, then A is not regular.</p>

<h5>Steps to apply pumping lemma</h5>
Step 1: Assume that Language A is Regular.

Step 2: It has to have a Pumping Length (say P).

Step 3: All strings longer than P can be pumped |S| ≥ P.

Step 4: Now, find a string ‘S’ in A such that |S| ≥ P.

Step 5: Divide S into x y z strings.

Step 6: Show that xy<sup>i</sup>z ∉ A for some i.

Step 7: Then consider how S can be divided into x y z.

Step 8: Show that none of the above strings satisfies all three pumping conditions simultaneously.

Step 9: S cannot be pumped == CONTRADICTION.
<p>Detailed description of the steps mentioned above:</p>
<p><b>1.  Assume the language L is regular:</b> This is the starting point for the proof</p>
<p><b>2. Identify the pumping length (p):</b> The pumping lemma guarantees the existence of a pumping length p for any regular language. This p applies to all strings in the language with a length greater than or equal to p (L ≥ p).</p>
<p><b>3. Choose a string S ∈ L and |S| ≥ p:</b> Select a string S from the language L that has a length greater than or equal to the pumping length (p).</p>
<p><b>4.Divide S into three substrings:</b> Divide the chosen string S into three substrings as follows:

x: A prefix of S (can be empty).
y: The substring to be "pumped" (must have at least one symbol).
z: The suffix of S after y (can be empty).
Therefore, the string S can be represented as S=xyz.</p>
<P><b>5.Apply pumping for different values of i:</b> The lemma states that we can "pump" the substring y by inserting copies of it i times </P>
<p><b>6.Analyze the resulting strings:</b> The key step is to analyze the resulting strings (xz, s, and x(y<sup>i</sup>)z) and show that at least one of them does not belong to the language L. This contradicts the initial assumption that L is regular.</p>
