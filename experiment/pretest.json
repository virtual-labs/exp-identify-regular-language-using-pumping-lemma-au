        "a": "To prove that a language is regular",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The lemma does not prove regularity, it tests non-regularity.",
        "b": "Correct! The Pumping Lemma is primarily used to show that certain languages are not regular.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Conversion is unrelated to the Pumping Lemma.",

      "answers": {
        "a": "A string s can be divided into xyz such that xy^i z ∈ L for all i ≥ 0",
        "b": "A string s can be divided into uvw such that u^i v w^i ∈ L for i ≥ 1",
        "c": "All strings in the language must be of length less than p",
        "d": "The language must contain only finite strings"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! This is the key condition of the Pumping Lemma for regular languages.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is related to context-free languages, not regular languages.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The lemma deals with strings longer than the pumping length.",

    {
      "question": "Why does the Pumping Lemma hold for regular languages?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because regular languages can be represented by context-free grammars",
        "b": "Because finite automata have a finite number of states, creating loops for long strings",
        "c": "Because regular languages are finite",
        "d": "Because strings in regular languages are always periodic"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Context-free grammars are not relevant here.",
        "b": "Correct! Loops in finite automata for strings longer than the number of states ensure the lemma holds.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Regular languages can be infinite.",

        "a": "It can be removed or repeated to generate new strings in the language",
        "b": "It must be empty",
        "c": "It represents the prefix of s",
        "d": "It contains all the symbols of the alphabet"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! y is the 'pumpable' part that can be repeated or removed.",
        "b": "Incorrect. y must contain at least one symbol.",
        "c": "Incorrect. x is the prefix.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Violating the lemma means the language cannot be regular.",
        "b": "Correct! If any string fails the pumping conditions, the language is not regular.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Context-free is unrelated here.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The language may still be infinite."

      "question": "Which of the following statements is true regarding the pumping length p?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All strings shorter than p are guaranteed to violate the lemma",
        "b": "Only strings longer than or equal to p are considered for pumping",
        "c": "p is the maximum length of a string in the language",
        "d": "p is the number of symbols in the alphabet"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Short strings do not need to be pumped.",
        "b": "Correct! The lemma applies to strings with length ≥ p.",
