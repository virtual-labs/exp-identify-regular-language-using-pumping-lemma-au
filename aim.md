The aim of this experiment is to **apply the Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages** to analyze formal languages and determine whether they are regular or not.  
Using the lemma, we will examine strings of sufficient length in a language, decompose them into parts according to the lemmaâ€™s conditions, and attempt to "pump" specific substrings.  

If the pumped strings do not remain within the language, it serves as proof that the language is **not regular**.  
This experiment highlights the **theoretical limitations of regular languages** and the **practical application of the Pumping Lemma** in proving non-regularity.
